 * This question is asked in Samsung Interview. <br>
 * 
 * Given two unsorted arrays A of size N and B of size M of distinct elements,
 * the task is to find all pairs from both arrays whose sum is equal to X. 
 * Note: All pairs should be printed in increasing order of u.
 * 
 * For eg. for two pairs (u1,v1) and (u2,v2),
 * if u1 < u2 then (u1,v1) should be printed first else second.

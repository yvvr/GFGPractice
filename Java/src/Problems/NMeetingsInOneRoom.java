 *
 * <p>There is one meeting room in a firm. There are N meetings in the form of (start[i], end[i])
 * where start[i] is start time of meeting i and end[i] is finish time of meeting i. What is the
 * maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in the meeting room when only one meeting can
 * be held in the meeting room at a particular time?
 *
 * <p>Note: Start time of one chosen meeting can't be equal to the end time of the other chosen
 * meeting.
 *
 * <p>Expected Time Complexity : O(N*LogN), Expected Auxiliary Space : O(N)
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 * 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
 * 0 ≤ start[i] < end[i] ≤ 10^5
